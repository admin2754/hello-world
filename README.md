# hello-world
Hello World is a very basic way to introduce me to GitHub. 
So, let's start learning how it works. But, first a few words about myself.
I have a bachelor degree in Advertising (minor) on Social Communication (major) and a MBA in Business Communication.
I work in advertising way back before the Apple Macintosh era. Inside the agency we had drawing desks, drawing paralel rulers, darkroom photo lab, drawing pens, painting inks and talented illustrators. Copy, cut and paste were artwork routine with real glue. 
In 2000, I started some classes on SmartPlanet: "Building Online Communities", "ASP Database", "Learning Java", "HTML and CSS" etc. Since then, I realized that Internet is really an Interactive Eco System that evolves every minute. Is a field to adapt and learn always. 
Today, I'm looking for production scalability in SEO, site optimization, building fast – landing pages, email marketing, forms with PHP that work on any server – and inbound marketing tools.
